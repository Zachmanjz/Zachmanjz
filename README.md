### Hi, I'm Jeremy Zach!
I'm a front-end developer.

I am a motivated self taught front end developer with a master's degree. From the moment I produced "hello world" in the console of my first application, I was hooked to using code as a tool to build responsive, robust websites. I always found coding intuitive and have pushed myself to learn the most effective ways to achieve a result. I am a fast learner, outstanding interpersonal skills and can quickly integrate into a team so I can provide value to the company and clients.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Building an election map using Javascript
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and PHP
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with best ways to validate forms on the backend.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: zach.jeremy@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a master's degree.  I love hot sauce and EDM.
